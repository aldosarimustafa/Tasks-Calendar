# _Tasks Calendar_
---

## Point of This App
I dedicated my time to make this app perfect for a user to use and enjoy. I made it very simple for the user, so that everyone would be able to use my app and not have any problems. A _calendar_ is a really important tool in everyone's lifes, so I wanted to make an app that would help people organize their tasks and know what they have to do to be prepared for the future.

## My User Story

_As a user_, I want to be able to login with my personal acount and be able to add tasks and discriptions with due dates to the calendar. I would also like to be able to _delete_, _edit_, and _update_ my tasks when I need to.
